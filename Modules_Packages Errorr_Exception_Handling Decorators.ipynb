An error can be a ````syntax```` (parsing) error, while there can be many types of exceptions that could occur during the execution and are not unconditionally inoperable. An ````Error```` might indicate critical problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch, while an ````Exception```` might indicate conditions that an application should try to catch. Errors are a form of an unchecked exception and are irrecoverable like an ````OutOfMemoryError````, which a programmer should not try to handle.\n",
