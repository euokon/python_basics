    "The Python Imaging Library (PIL) is a 3rd party Python package that adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. It allows you to process photos and do many common image file manipulations. The current version of this software is in Pillow, which is a fork of the original PIL to support Python 3. Several other Python packages, such as wxPython and ReportLab, use Pillow to support loading many different image file types. You can use Pillow for several use cases including the following:\n",
